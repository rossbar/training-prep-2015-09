 I thought that the instructor did a good job of using questions as an opportunity to introduce new concepts, for instance, when she introduced the array.shape feature when someone asked about the dimensionality of the example array. I also thought she did a good job of being conscious of logistical considerations like the text-size and screen-scrolling speed. I think the major drawback of the lesson plan was the degree of open-endedness of the example. There was no compelling use-case so the lesson was more of a feature-introduction with very wide scope. For example, when the instructor asks the students what should be used as input to np.array(), she gets many answers back including the number of dimensions etc. There is nothing wrong with this per se, but I think it is more compelling and easier to learn new tools given a tangible example to work on. Having a more concrete example would also help to reduce the instances of "back-tracking" where the result of a demonstration turns out a bit different than expected, as in the introduction to slicing.

 I am very passionate about teaching and computation, and especially their intersection. I have been a graduate student instructor for 6 out of my 11 semesters at UC Berkeley, including this current semester, where I am helping to teach a class in the statistics department on reproducible and collaborative science with Jarrod Millman. I also try to be as active as possible (schedule permitting) in campus groups such as the BIDS-sponsored The Hacker Within.
